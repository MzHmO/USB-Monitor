## How to work with it
This tool uses WMI to retrieve information about newly connected USB devices. If a USB Flash Drive is inserted, the contents of the flash drive with the specified depth are output. You can change the depth [here](https://github.com/MzHmO/USB-Monitor/blob/main/USB-Monitor/Program.cs#L39)
